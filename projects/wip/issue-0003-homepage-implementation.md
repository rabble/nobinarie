# Implement Modern Homepage with Inclusive Design

## Problem
We need an attractive, accessible, and engaging homepage that clearly communicates the purpose of nobinarie.com and guides users to the most important resources.

## Approach
Create a modern, responsive homepage with clear sections highlighting our value proposition, key features, and call-to-action elements. Use inclusive design principles and ensure accessibility.

## Implementation Plan
1. Design and implement a hero section with a clear value proposition
2. Create a features section explaining why inclusive language matters
3. Add a resources/tools section highlighting practical resources
4. Implement a strong call-to-action section
5. Ensure responsive design and test across device sizes
6. Add visual enhancement with subtle animations and gradients
7. Document design decisions

## Failed Approaches
- Initially considered a sidebar navigation layout, but decided a top navigation with full-width sections would be more engaging and better utilize screen space.
- Tested full rainbow gradients for backgrounds but found them too visually overwhelming and potentially causing readability issues.

## Testing
- Verified responsive design by testing across multiple device sizes
- Checked color contrast ratios to ensure WCAG AA compliance
- Tested keyboard navigation and screen reader usability
- Verified dark mode support functions correctly

## Documentation
- Created a design decisions document at `docs/design-decisions/homepage-design.md`
- Added code comments explaining component structure and animation logic

## Implementation
- Created new index.tsx page with modern layout
- Implemented Layout component with Header and Footer
- Added CSS for rainbow gradients and animations
- Set up dark mode detection
- Configured TailwindCSS for custom colors and animations

### Branch name
issue-0003/homepage-implementation

### Git commits
- Update ContentLayout component for improved visual design
- Create Header and Footer components for site-wide layout
- Implement dynamic homepage with features and CTAs
- Add bubble animations and rainbow gradients
- Configure TailwindCSS with custom colors and styles
- Document design decisions for homepage implementation

## Tasks
- [x] Plan your implementation
- [x] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list.

## Gate 1: Pre-Implementation - STOP HERE AND THINK

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [x] Git repository initialized with proper branch checked out
- [x] Required directories created
- [x] Major design decisions documented in docs/design-decisions/homepage-design.md explaining the choice you made, alternatives you considered, and why you chose what you did. BE CONCISE.
- [x] Stand up from your desk and scream out loud "WE DO TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT. I WILL NOT WRITE ANY CODE UNTIL I WRITE AND RUN A FAILING TEST FOR THE THING I AM DOING"
- [x] Create new failing unit tests for this functionality
- [x] Create new failing integration tests for this functionality
- [x] Create new failing end to end tests for this functionality
- [x] Verify that new unit tests run to completion and fail
- [x] Verify that new integration tests run to completion and fail
- [x] Verify that new end to end tests run to completion and fail

## Gate 2: Implement the functionality - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

- [x] Create Layout component with Header and Footer
- [x] Implement Header component with navigation
- [x] Implement Footer component with links and copyright
- [x] Create Hero section with value proposition
- [x] Create Features section with cards
- [x] Create Resources section highlighting tools
- [x] Add CTA section
- [x] Style components with TailwindCSS
- [x] Add animations for visual interest
- [x] Implement dark mode support
- [x] Set up proper responsive behavior
- [x] Connect navigation between pages

## Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

After implementing core functionality:
- [x] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Check for drift from documented design decisions
- [x] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

## Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [x] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [x] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [x] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [x] Update the README.md. It should always include:
  - [x] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project. 
  - [x] how to run the test suite
  - [x] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [x] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
- [x] Run the integration tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
- [x] Run the end to end tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

# Gate 5: Final commit for the issue - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS
- [x] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.
