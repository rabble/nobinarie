# Dictionary Files Setup

## Problem
We need to create and serve the Spanish inclusive language dictionary files in various formats suitable for different spell checking software. These dictionaries must be accessible for download from the website and properly organized with versioning and documentation.

## Approach
Implement the dictionary system with versioning, file generation, and proper metadata. Create a dictionary file management library with functions to list, package, and serve dictionaries. Implement the downloads page that showcases the dictionaries and provides installation instructions.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create the base dictionary file format with inclusive Spanish terms
2. Set up the versioning system for dictionaries
3. Implement conversion to multiple dictionary formats:
   - Hunspell (.dic/.aff)
   - LanguageTool (.xml)
   - Text format (.txt)
4. Create a system to generate downloadable packages with proper documentation
5. Implement the downloads page with version listings and installation guides
6. Add a changelog system to track dictionary improvements

## Failed Approaches
None yet.

## Testing
- Unit tests for dictionary file generation functions
- Integration tests for the dictionary management system
- End-to-end tests for the downloads page and file downloads
- Verify correct dictionary file formatting for all supported platforms

## Documentation
- Document the dictionary format and structure
- Create installation guides for each supported platform
- Add detailed changelog format for version tracking

## Implementation
- Branch: `issue-0005/dictionary-files-setup`
- Commits: TBD

## Tasks

**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**

- [ ] Plan your implementation
- [ ] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list.

## Gate 1: Pre-Implementation - STOP HERE AND THINK

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper branch checked out
- [ ] Required directories created
- [ ] Major design decisions documented in docs/design-decisions/dictionary-format.md explaining the choice you made, alternatives you considered, and why you chose what you did. BE CONCISE.
- [ ] Stand up from your desk and scream out loud "WE DO TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT. I WILL NOT WRITE ANY CODE UNTIL I WRITE AND RUN A FAILING TEST FOR THE THING I AM DOING"
- [ ] Create new failing unit tests for this functionality
- [ ] Create new failing integration tests for this functionality
- [ ] Create new failing end to end tests for this functionality
- [ ] Verify that new unit tests run to completion and fail
- [ ] Verify that new integration tests run to completion and fail
- [ ] Verify that new end to end tests run to completion and fail

## Gate 2: Implement the functionality - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

- [ ] Create base dictionary file format
- [ ] Implement dictionary versioning system
- [ ] Create dictionary file generation for Hunspell format
- [ ] Create dictionary file generation for LanguageTool format
- [ ] Create dictionary file generation for plain text format
- [ ] Implement downloadable package creation
- [ ] Create the dictionary downloads page
- [ ] Add installation instructions for each platform
- [ ] Implement dictionary changelog system
- [ ] Add API for retrieving dictionary versions and files

## Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

After implementing core functionality:
- [ ] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Check for drift from documented design decisions
- [ ] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

## Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [ ] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [ ] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [ ] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [ ] Update the README.md. It should always include:
  - [ ] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project.
  - [ ] how to run the test suite
  - [ ] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [ ] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
- [ ] Run the integration tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
- [ ] Run the end to end tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

## Gate 5: Final commit for the issue - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS
- [ ] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5
NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have unit tests, integration tests, AND end-to-end tests. If you believe a test type doesn't apply, you are mistaken - create it and run it anyway.
