# Create Platform-Specific Installation Tutorials

## Problem
We need to develop detailed tutorials for each supported platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, web browsers) that guide users through the process of installing and using the inclusive Spanish dictionaries.

## Approach
Create comprehensive, step-by-step tutorials with screenshots for each platform, explaining how to install and use the inclusive Spanish dictionaries in various applications.

## Implementation Plan
1. Research dictionary installation processes for each platform
2. Create tutorial pages for each platform:
   - Windows tutorial
   - macOS tutorial
   - Linux tutorial
   - Android tutorial
   - iOS tutorial
   - Web browsers tutorials (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Take screenshots for each step of the installation process
4. Write clear instructions in inclusive Spanish
5. Implement consistent layout and navigation for all tutorial pages
6. Add troubleshooting sections for common issues

## Failed Approaches
None yet.

## Testing
- Verify tutorials are accurate by following them on each platform
- Test responsiveness across devices
- Ensure all links and screenshots work correctly
- Validate accessibility requirements

## Documentation
- Document tutorial structure
- Create guidelines for updating tutorials when platforms change

## Implementation
- Branch: `issue-0006/platform-tutorials`
- Commits: TBD

## Tasks

**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**

- [ ] Plan your implementation
- [ ] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list.

## Gate 1: Pre-Implementation - STOP HERE AND THINK

Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper branch checked out
- [ ] Required directories created
- [ ] Major design decisions documented in docs/design-decisions/tutorial-layout.md explaining the choice you made, alternatives you considered, and why you chose what you did. BE CONCISE.
- [ ] Stand up from your desk and scream out loud "WE DO TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT. I WILL NOT WRITE ANY CODE UNTIL I WRITE AND RUN A FAILING TEST FOR THE THING I AM DOING"
- [ ] Create new failing unit tests for this functionality
- [ ] Create new failing integration tests for this functionality
- [ ] Create new failing end to end tests for this functionality
- [ ] Verify that new unit tests run to completion and fail
- [ ] Verify that new integration tests run to completion and fail
- [ ] Verify that new end to end tests run to completion and fail

## Gate 2: Implement the functionality - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

- [ ] Research dictionary installation for Windows
- [ ] Research dictionary installation for macOS
- [ ] Research dictionary installation for Linux
- [ ] Research dictionary installation for Android
- [ ] Research dictionary installation for iOS
- [ ] Research dictionary installation for web browsers
- [ ] Create Windows tutorial page with screenshots
- [ ] Create macOS tutorial page with screenshots
- [ ] Create Linux tutorial page with screenshots
- [ ] Create Android tutorial page with screenshots
- [ ] Create iOS tutorial page with screenshots
- [ ] Create web browsers tutorials with screenshots
- [ ] Add troubleshooting sections for common issues
- [ ] Implement consistent navigation between tutorial pages

## Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

After implementing core functionality:
- [ ] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Check for drift from documented design decisions
- [ ] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

## Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
- [ ] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [ ] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
- [ ] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
- [ ] Update the README.md. It should always include:
  - [ ] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project.
  - [ ] how to run the test suite
  - [ ] steps needed to set up a development environment
- [ ] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
- [ ] Run the integration tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
- [ ] Run the end to end tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output

## Gate 5: Final commit for the issue - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS
- [ ] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5
NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have unit tests, integration tests, AND end-to-end tests. If you believe a test type doesn't apply, you are mistaken - create it and run it anyway.
