# Layout and Accessibility Design Decision

## Decision

For the nobinarie.com layout and accessibility features, we've chosen:

- **Layout Structure**: Modular component-based layout with separate Header, Footer, and main content area
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Accessibility Features**:
  - Semantic HTML5 elements
  - ARIA attributes for interactive components
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Focus management
  - Color contrast compliance (WCAG AA)
  - Font size toggle for readability
  - Support for screen readers
  - Dark mode support for light sensitivity

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Layout Approaches**:
   - Page-specific layouts: Would lead to code duplication and inconsistency
   - CSS Grid-only layouts: Less flexible for certain responsive behaviors
   - Framework-specific layout components (e.g., Chakra UI): Would add substantial bundle size

2. **Accessibility Approaches**:
   - Using a dedicated accessibility library: More comprehensive but adds bundle size
   - Manual ARIA implementations: More control but risk of inconsistency
   - CSS-only accessibility solutions: Limited functionality for complex interactions

3. **Dark Mode Implementation**:
   - CSS variables approach: More flexible but more complex
   - Tailwind's class-based approach: Simpler but less customizable
   - JavaScript-only theme switching: More control but potential flash of incorrect theme

## Rationale

1. **Modular Component Structure**:
   - Promotes reusability and consistency across pages
   - Simplifies maintenance as the site grows
   - Enables targeted testing of individual components
   - Follows React best practices for component composition

2. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**:
   - Ensures good experience on all devices (mobile usage is growing)
   - Aligns with progressive enhancement principles
   - Uses Tailwind's responsive utilities for maintainability
   - Simplifies responsive testing and development

3. **Comprehensive Accessibility Features**:
   - Ensures compliance with WCAG AA standards
   - Makes the site usable by people with diverse abilities
   - Supports the project's inclusive values and mission
   - Improves SEO and general user experience

4. **Class-based Dark Mode with Local Storage**:
   - Prevents flash of incorrect theme on page load
   - Respects user preferences but allows manual override
   - Integrates well with Tailwind's dark mode support
   - Minimizes JavaScript requirements for theme switching
