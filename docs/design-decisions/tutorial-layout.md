# Tutorial Layout Design Decision

## Decision

We've implemented a structured, step-by-step tutorial layout for platform-specific installation guides with the following key elements:

1. A consistent ContentLayout component as the base for all tutorial pages
2. Numbered steps with clear visual indicators and supporting screenshots
3. Platform-specific sections with color-coded elements for each application
4. Troubleshooting sections for common issues
5. Navigation links to related resources

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Video Tutorials
- **Pros**: Visual demonstrations are effective for complex tasks
- **Cons**: Higher production costs, accessibility concerns, difficult to update when platforms change

### Option 2: Simple Text-Based Instructions
- **Pros**: Easy to create and maintain, low bandwidth requirements
- **Cons**: Less engaging, harder to follow complex steps without visual guidance

### Option 3: Interactive Tutorials (Guided Step-by-Step)
- **Pros**: Highly engaging, verifies user completion of each step
- **Cons**: Technically complex to implement, may not work correctly across devices

## Decision Rationale

We chose the structured text-and-image approach because:

1. **Balanced Approach**: It provides clear visual guidance through screenshots while keeping technical requirements minimal
2. **Accessibility**: Text-based content with images maintains good accessibility with proper alt text
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update than videos when platforms change their interfaces
4. **Consistent Experience**: Works well across devices and bandwidth conditions
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Breaking instructions into numbered steps with visual cues reduces complexity

The structured approach with the ContentLayout component ensures consistency across all tutorial pages while allowing for platform-specific customization. The numbered steps with accompanying screenshots make the instructions clear and easy to follow.

## Implementation Details

- Use ContentLayout component for consistent page structure
- Follow a logical progression: intro → prerequisites → step-by-step instructions → troubleshooting
- Include high-quality screenshots for each significant step
- Use color-coding to distinguish between different applications (e.g., LibreOffice, Firefox)
- Include "next steps" section to guide users to related resources
- Add troubleshooting section for common installation issues

## Future Considerations

- May add video supplements for complex procedures if resource constraints allow
- Consider automated testing of instructions as platforms update
- Potential for localization of tutorial content to additional languages
- User feedback mechanism to help identify unclear steps or missing information
