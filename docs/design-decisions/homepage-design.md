# Homepage Design Decision

## Decision

For the nobinarie.com homepage design, we've chosen:

- **Visual Style**: Vibrant, colorful design inspired by queer & trans liberation aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: Progressive pride flag inspired colors with gradient transitions
- **Typography**: Playful, bold headlines with accessible body text
- **Layout**: Welcoming hero section with clear call-to-action 
- **Imagery**: Inclusive illustrations and abstract patterns
- **Tone**: Celebratory, affirming, and empowering

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Visual Style Approaches**:
   - Corporate/tech startup aesthetic: Too formal and conventional
   - Minimalist design: Might feel clinical and less welcoming
   - Academic/educational style: Could feel institutional and less personal

2. **Color Palette Options**:
   - Monochromatic scheme: Less expressive of queer & trans celebration
   - Muted tones: Less joyful and celebratory
   - Traditional binary color schemes: At odds with the non-binary mission

3. **Layout Approaches**:
   - Text-heavy design: Could reduce immediate engagement
   - Complex multi-column layout: Might create accessibility challenges
   - Video-first approach: Could increase load times and reduce accessibility

## Rationale

1. **Pride-Inspired Visual Style**:
   - Aligns visually with the community the project serves
   - Creates immediate recognition of the site's purpose and values
   - Expresses joy and celebration rather than formality
   - Makes a welcoming first impression for all users

2. **Vibrant Color Scheme**:
   - Reflects the diversity and vibrancy of the community
   - Creates visual interest and engagement
   - Provides opportunities for meaningful color usage throughout the site
   - Can be implemented while maintaining WCAG contrast requirements

3. **Bold, Clear Call-to-Action**:
   - Prioritizes the primary user path (dictionary download)
   - Makes the site's utility immediately apparent
   - Reduces friction for users seeking the main functionality
   - Supports the site's mission of making inclusive language tools accessible

4. **Balanced Visual Approach**:
   - Combines celebration with practicality
   - Ensures the site remains professional while being joyful
   - Appeals to diverse audiences including activists, educators, and casual users
