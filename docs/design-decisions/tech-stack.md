# Technology Stack Design Decision

## Decision

For the nobinarie.com project, we've chosen the following technology stack:

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Deployment**: Static site export to Cloudflare Pages
- **Content Management**: MDX for content authoring

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Frameworks**:
   - Gatsby.js: Good for static sites but more complex than needed for our use case
   - Astro: Excellent for content-focused sites but newer with smaller community
   - Plain React: Would require more manual configuration for routing and SSG

2. **Styling Approaches**:
   - CSS Modules: Less utility-focused than Tailwind, requires more custom CSS
   - Styled Components: Good for component-based styling but adds runtime overhead
   - Plain CSS: Would require more manual work for responsive design

3. **Deployment Options**:
   - Vercel: Excellent integration with Next.js but Cloudflare offers better global CDN
   - Netlify: Good static hosting but Cloudflare Pages has better performance globally
   - GitHub Pages: Simpler but fewer features than Cloudflare Pages

## Rationale

1. **Next.js with TypeScript**:
   - Strong typing helps prevent errors and improves developer experience
   - Built-in static export capabilities
   - Well-established framework with large community support
   - Excellent performance optimizations
   - Good SEO capabilities

2. **TailwindCSS**:
   - Utility-first approach enables rapid development
   - Highly customizable to match design requirements
   - Built-in responsive design utilities
   - Good dark mode support
   - Excellent tree-shaking for production builds

3. **Cloudflare Pages**:
   - Global CDN for fast loading worldwide
   - Free hosting with generous limits
   - Built-in analytics
   - Easy integration with CI/CD workflows
   - Excellent performance

4. **MDX for Content**:
   - Combines Markdown ease with React component flexibility
   - Enables non-technical contributors to edit content
   - Separates content from presentation
   - Easy to maintain and update
