# Content Management Design Decision

## Decision

For the nobinarie.com content pages, we've chosen:

- **Content Structure**: Markdown/MDX files for easy authoring and maintenance
- **Layout**: Consistent template across content pages with shared components
- **Navigation**: Organized navigation with logical grouping of related topics
- **Styling**: Consistent visual style matching the homepage's vibrant aesthetic
- **Accessibility**: Focus on readability with good contrast and semantic structure

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Content Management Approaches**:
   - Database-driven content: More complex than needed for a static site
   - Hard-coded JSX content: Less maintainable for non-technical contributors
   - Headless CMS: Adds infrastructure complexity without significant benefits for this project
   - JSON data files: Less writer-friendly than Markdown

2. **Layout Strategies**:
   - Page-specific layouts: Would lead to inconsistency and maintenance overhead
   - Single rigid layout: Would lack flexibility for different content types
   - Completely custom layouts per page: Would create a disjointed user experience

3. **Content Organization**:
   - Flat content structure: Less organized and harder to navigate
   - Deeply nested hierarchy: Could complicate routing and create overly long URLs
   - Topic-based grouping only: Would miss opportunities for logical progression

## Rationale

1. **Markdown/MDX for Content**:
   - Easy authoring for both technical and non-technical contributors
   - Good separation of content from presentation
   - Static site generation for fast performance
   - Version control friendly for collaborative editing
   - Support for rich content including components when needed

2. **Consistent Template with Flexibility**:
   - Creates a unified experience across all content pages
   - Maintains the vibrant, inclusive aesthetic of the site
   - Provides layout flexibility where needed for different content types
   - Simplifies maintenance since changes to shared components affect all pages

3. **Logical Content Organization**:
   - Groups related content for easy discovery
   - Provides clear paths through the content
   - Supports both browsing and direct access patterns
   - Reflects the natural relationships between different topics

4. **Accessibility-First Approach**:
   - Ensures content is accessible to all users
   - Uses semantic HTML structure for screen readers
   - Maintains color contrast requirements despite vibrant design
   - Prioritizes readability of content for all users
